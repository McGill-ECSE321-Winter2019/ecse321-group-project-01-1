# ECSE321 Project 01


Welcome to our ECSE 321 group 01 repository. In this project, we are tasked with creating a "Co-operator" application that should help expand McGill university's coop programs. The main goal of project is to streamline the coop process through a web app and a mobile application. To do this, it must interact with multiple actors such as the coop student, the employer, the coop-administrator and the academic program manager, however our scope will be focused solely on the student viewpoint. 

The main goals for our viewpoint are to create a web and mobile application capable for a coop student so that they may enroll in a coop term and progress through it by submitting various forms.
